# Segmentation
High-Utility Sequential Rule Mining Based on Segmentation

The NoRepeat directory contains the implementation code of the algorithms RSC, RSCN, TotalSR and TotalUS, all of which are designed for mining sequences without repeated items. In these implementations, only the item with the highest utility is retained if duplicates appear within a sequence. The method TotalUS is implemented in Comparators.java under the TotalSR folder, and the execution mode can be specified in the main class Algo.java.
